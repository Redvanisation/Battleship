## About The Project

Based on the [PROJECT: BATTLESHIP](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship) in the odin project as a part of the Microverse curriculum.

The purpose is to get a good understanding how to create the [battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game in ES6 using test driven development with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

The following are actions that can be done on the application.
  1. Start the game to deploy the ships.
  2. Click on the board to destroy the computer ships.
  3. If you destroy all the computer ships first you win.
  4. Good luck!

### Built With
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
